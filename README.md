# Rust Spinning Donut
In short I remade the popular spinning donut code, originally created in C back in 2006, in Rust. I tried to keep my code as donuty and faithful to the original as possible.
Simply run the code and an extremely charismatic donut will start spinning on your screen!
You can find more info on the original spinning donut made by Andy Sloane and all the math behind it here: https://www.a1k0n.net/2011/07/20/donut-math.html
